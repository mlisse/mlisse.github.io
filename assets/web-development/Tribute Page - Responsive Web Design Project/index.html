<h3 class="text-center">Equipment</h3>
<div id="listsec">

<p>
    <li id="year">Tachi:</li>
      <li id="race">When he first met Gon, Kite used a long, slightly curved katana as his primary <br> weapon. It has a black scabbard and a matching hilt without a tsuba. He carried <br> it by hanging it to his left shoulder through a piece of thread attached to the koiguchi <br>(scabbard mouth). He used it to kill the foxbear that was attacking Gon.</li>
</p>   
<p>
</div>
</div>

	<div id="listmain">
<h3 class="text-center">Abilities & Powers</h3>
<div id="listsec">

	<p>
    <li id="year">Enhanced Strength</li>
      <li id="race">Kite can swing his weapons with a single hand and no effort. <br> In his first appearance, he bisected an adult Foxbear with only a one-handed slash.</li>
  </p>

  <p>
     <li id="year">Enhanced Speed</li>
      <li id="race">Kite can match Gon and Killua in terms of running speed.  Furthermore, he moved <br> so fast that Rammot, who easily kept up with the boys, could not track his movements. <br> Although it should be noted that Gon is a slow starter[19] and Killua still had Illumi's <br> needle planted in his brain at the time. He was also able to kill Yunju, a Squadron <br>Leader, in the few seconds Gon needed to charge his Jajanken.  On more than one <br> occasion, Kite has been shown to be able to move his left arm so fast, and gracefully <br> it leaves two afterimages. Since he does this in preparation for a fight, it is likely this is <br> a sort of battle stance, implying he might have learned <br>some martial art.</li>
</p>

  <p>
     <li id="year">Enhanced Stamina</li>
      <li id="race">Kite can cover long distances running alongside Gon and Killua without tiring. <br> A true testament to his endurance is given by the fact that he was able to fight <br> the monstrously powerful Neferpitou after the shock and blood loss resulting from <br>having his right arm cut off.</li>
</p>

     <li id="year">Immense Endurance</li>
      <li id="race">Kite withstood having his arm ripped off and still continued fighting, even inflicting <br> a few wounds on a newborn Neferpitou.
</p>

<p>

     <li id="year">Keen Intellect</li>
      <li id="race">Kite is able to accurately assess the risks of a mission, and come up with <br> countermeasures to cope with dire situations. He seems particularly knowledgeable about <br> biology, enough to convince a corporation to enlist him to do an important biological <br> survey in Kakin.
</p>

<p>

     <li id="year">Proficient Hand-to-Hand Combatant</li>
      <li id="race">Although he seems to prefer to rely on his weapons, Kite is hinted to be rather capable <br> at fighting with his bare hands. In the anime, he single-handedly redirected Yunju's attacks <br> and landed a high kick on his face. When his corpse was under the effect of Neferpitou's <br> ability, he was unable to use Nen, but Shoot still commented he had a hard time defeating <br>him and that he was dangerous nonetheless.
</p>

<p>

     <li id="year">Master Weapon Specialist</li>
      <li id="race">Having chosen an ability that forces him to use a random weapon, it can be inferred <br>that Kite is extremely adaptable: he can wield blunt weapons, firearms, and swords with <br> dexterity, although he does seem to prefer some weapons over others: for example, <br> he has a strong distaste for the scythe. When he carried a katana, he wielded it with one<br> hand.

<h3 class="text-center">Kite's Nen Type: Conjuration</h3>
<div id="listsec">


<p>

     <li id="year">Crazy Slots (気狂いピエロクレイジースロット Mad Clown)</li>
      <li id="race">Kite's Nen ability is called Crazy Slots and allows him to conjure some weapons with a<br> clown affixed to it. A roulette appears on the clown's tongue with numbers 1 to 9, each<br> corresponding to a specific weapon. Whatever number randomly appears, the weapon that<br> corresponds to that number is conjured, which means that Kite cannot choose what weapon<br> to summon. He included this restriction to increase the power of the individual weapons. <br>The weapon drawn will not disappear until used. The clown on Crazy Slots can also talk <br>and comment on Kite's actions and conditions, usually to his chagrin. Only three of his<br> weapons are shown in the manga: a scythe, a carbine, and a mace. According to Ging,<br> the Crazy Slots ability has a number that only comes up when Kite desperately does not<br> want to die. Its power is so great that Kite managed to reincarnate as Meruem's twin <br> sibling after his death.
</p>

<p>
     <li id="year">Number 2: Scythe</li>
      <li id="race">Kite conjures a very sharp and enormous scythe. It cannot be dispelled until <br>Kite uses Silent Waltz, which is also the only way the scythe can be utilized.
      	<br> <b>Silent Waltz (死神の円舞曲サイレントワルツ Grim Reaper's Dance):</b> After increasing the <br> size of the blade, Kite swings it in a circle, generating an invisible slash that propagates in <br>all directions. When he used it against a platoon of Chimera Ants, it bisected every one <br> of them and fell the trees around him.
</p>

<p>
     <li id="year">Number 3: Mace</li>
      <li id="race">Kite conjures a clown-like mace or a stick, which he seems to wield the weapon<br> with a reverse grip. The true orientation and function of this weapon is still largely<br> unknown. The clown, however, refers to it as a "good number".
</p>

<p>
     <li id="year">Number 4: Carbine</li>
      <li id="race">Kite conjures a carbine with its shape similar to a long-barreled handgun combined<br> with an extremely long buttstock. It can shoot powerful bullets in quick succession and<br> seemingly without making any noise. Regarding the "long-barreled" element described<br> above, alternatively, the front part/piece of the weapon is similar to and could be a type<br> of suppressor (even being distinctively colored in the anime),which would explain the lack<br> or reduced amount of noise.

<h3 class="text-center"><span style="color:#16A085;">TRIVIA</span></h3>
<div id="listsec">


<p>
      <li id="race">Kite is the first character to be shown in the manga.
</p>

<p>
      <li id="race">In one of Hunter × Hunter's card collections, the character is also <br> alternatively named as <b>"Kcyytt"</b>.
</p>

<p>
      <li id="race">Kite did not play the Greed Island game properly, but he reveals that <br> Ging took him inside the game once.
</p>

<p>
      	<li id="race"> His in-game nickname was probably "Ngig" (ＮＩＧＧ).
</p>

<p>
      	<li id="race">After entering NGL, Kite appears to wear the same outfit as before,<br> possibly suggesting that it was already made out entirely of natural fibers.
</p>

<p>
      	<li id="race">There is a running gag when Kite uses his <b>Crazy Slots </b>ability in which he <br> always complains he got a "bad spin". Despite this, he usually gets a very<br> good weapon for the situation at hand.
</p>

<p>
      	<li id="race">Kite is currently the only known Chimera Ant who both 	remembers their <br> past life and is of a different biological sex to their past self. They are also the <br> only Chimera Ant to show evident signs of growth.
</p>

<p>
      	<li id="race">The exact mechanics of Kite's rebirth are unknown. If the soul exists as a <br> physical or at least paranormal entity in the universe of the series, as Koala <br> may have implied, it is possible that Crazy Slots caused it to occupy the <br>body of a gestating Chimera Ant.
</p>

<p>
	<li id="race"> According to the "Hunter × Hunter Manual" section found in the Yu ☆ Yu ☆ <br> Hakusho official character book (Shueisha Jump remix),* Kite's stats are:
